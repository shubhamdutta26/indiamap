\title{Retrieve code11 for either a India state or district}
\usage{
code11(state, district = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The state(s) for which to obtain a code11 code(s).
 Can be entered as either a state abbreviation or full name (case-insensitive).

 `state` can be entered as either a single state or a vector of states.
 If `state` is a vector, `district` must be omitted.}

\item{district}{The county for which to obtain a code11 code.
Can be entered with or without "district" (case-insensitive).}
}
\value{
The code11 code(s) of given \code{state} or \code{district}.

If only states are entered, a vector of length equal to the number of states
is returned. If any states are not found or are invalid, `NA` is returned in their place.

If a state and district are entered, a single value with the code11 code
for the given district is returned. If the district is invalid for the given state,
an error is thrown.

If both `state` and `district` are omitted, the entire list of available code11
codes is returned, sorted by the state's abbreviation.
}
\description{
Each state and district has a unique two and five digit code11
  code respectively. Use this function to obtain the code11 code for a state or
  district.
}
\details{
State and district code11 are two and five digit codes, respectively.
  They uniquely identify all states and districts within India. They uniquely
  identify all states and districts within the United States. The state and
  district codes is merged into one code. The first two digits of the five
  digit district codes correspond to the state that the district belongs to.
}

A \code{state} must be included when searching for \code{district},
 otherwise multiple results may be returned for duplicate district names.
